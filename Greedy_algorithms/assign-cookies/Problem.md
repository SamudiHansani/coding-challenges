Given two arrays, greed[] and cookie[] such that greed[i] denotes the minimum cookie size wanted by ith child and cookie[i] denotes the size of ith cookie, the task is to find the maximum number of children that can be satisfied by assigning them cookies, with each child getting at most 1 cookie.

Note: A child will be satisfied if he is assigned a cookie of size at least equal to his greed. In other words, the ith child will be satified with jth cookie only if greed[i] <= cookie[j].
